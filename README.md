*Mistakes*

* I haven't made a website "from scratch" so to speak, since 2008
* I still haven't learned "JavaScript" ... my knowledge, what little I have, is still pretty much ES3
* Therefore this code is a mess ... I'm learning as I go along, and need to refactor!

14th June 2017

I've spent over two-weeks so far on this website.  During the discovery journey I've learned later-on:

* to use gulp, scss, & babel etc.
* that I need to completely refactor with better directory structure, and using ES2015 modules (jspm & systemJs)

If I refactor now, I'll never finish.  So I'm going to plough-on, and tidy/refactor later.
