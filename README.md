Nearly got to a stable point. "Live" on my staging server.

* Need to get HTML5 video element into place
* Need to do some video
* Need to address keyboard problem for navigation
* Need to move to "live" - live server
* Eventually tidy/use ES2015 modules
* Eventually use photographs & video on the "shapes" in the scene (when GPU is powerful enough)
* Eventually do more video, and automate links (top GitHub projects for example), and use MVC
  ... and dynamic content. Not sure yet if I'll turn this page into a SPA ... might be too heavy.
  ... Might add a complementary SPA using Angular, and use this page as a landing page.

14th June 2017
I've spent over two-weeks so far on this website.  During the discovery journey I've learned later-on:

* to use gulp, scss, & babel etc.
* that I need to completely refactor with better directory structure, and using ES2015 modules (jspm & systemJs)

If I refactor now, I'll never finish.  So I'm going to plough-on, and tidy/refactor later.


9th June => still under-construction & not live




Also using beep.js script (ignoring) in my js-debug-home directory:
See: https://github.com/luciferous/beepjs/blob/master/beep.js

*Mistakes*

* I haven't made a website "from scratch" so to speak, since 2008.
* I still haven't learned "JavaScript" ... my knowledge, what little I have, is still pretty much ES3
* Therefore this code is a mess ... I'm learning as I go along, and need to refactor!
* Accessibility is non-existent ... especially need to sort-out keyboard focus on menu ...
  can't just set display: none as using transforms to fly-menu-out from right, so have to script
